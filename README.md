#Project 4: Tandem learning app 

Client: Cecilia Trevino, Modern Language Centre, King's College London

- Project brief: The Modern Language Centre would like you to develop a location based and social discovery application for language exchange. The application will consist of a client app native to one or more mobile platform(s) and a server.  The system will allow students to find KCL native speakers for language exchange on KCL campuses using geolocation. 

The application can follow the model of Tandem app or Versify with the unique selling point of being exclusive for KCL students.

The users will be able to set a profile and schedule their availability for language exchange. The language exchanges can be possible via videoconference. The users will be able to earn points and badges for the using the app. 

Challenges and risks: As with Project 2, this project involves the development of a new social media platform.  You have a professional ethical duty to create a safe environment where users are protected from abuse and potentially criminal activity.  One particular risk is that the software encourages strangers to meet.  This requires careful consideration and collaboration with your client.  There are some obvious technical challenges in this project as well.

Licensing restrictions: This project may be delivered under an FSF or OSI approved software license.  If that may not possible (e.g. due to libraries used), the team must make an alternative arrangement with the client.
